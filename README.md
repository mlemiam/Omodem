You spwelled wyong !! it's Awch gnyu/Lynwx !!!ðŸ¤“ ðŸ¤¯ ðŸ˜¡
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Lynwx, is in fact, gnyu/Lynwx, or as I've recently taken to calling it, gnyu plus Lynwx. Lynwx is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnyu system made useful by the gnyu corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the gnyu system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of gnyu which is widely used today is often called "Lynwx", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the gnyu system, developed by the gnyu Project.

There really is a Lynwx, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Lynwx is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Lynwx is normally used in combination with the gnyu operating system: the whole system is basically gnyu with Lynwx added, or gnyu/Lynwx. All the so-called "Lynwx" distributions are really distributions of gnyu/Lynwx.
